Welcome!

I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon - <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/scot">SCOT</a> team. I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania under supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/">Francis X. Diebold</a> and Prof. <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/schorf/">Frank Schorfheide</a>.

My research interests include econometrics, machine learning, applied macroeconomics, and climate econometrics. 

My research focuses on grouped heterogeneity in panel data models. Iâ€™m particularly interested in bringing prior knowledge of the latent group structure into the models. It is an exciting topic that blends panel estimation with semi-supervised learning and social network models. [(Extended abstract)]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CBG_latest_ext_abs.pdf)
