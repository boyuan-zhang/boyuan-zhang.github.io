  title={Incorporating Prior Knowledge of Latent Group Structure in Panel Data Models (Job Market Paper)},
  abstract={The assumption of group heterogeneity has become popular in panel data models. We develop a constrained Bayesian grouped estimator that exploits researchers' prior beliefs on groups in a form of pairwise constraints, indicating whether a pair of units is likely to belong to a same group or different groups. We propose a prior to incorporate the pairwise constraints with varying degrees of confidence. The whole framework is built on the nonparametric Bayesian method, which implicitly specifies a distribution over the group partitions, and so the posterior analysis takes the uncertainty of the latent group structure into account. Monte Carlo experiments reveal that adding prior knowledge yields more accurate estimates of coefficient and scores predictive gains over alternative estimators. We apply our method to two empirical applications. In a first application to forecasting U.S. CPI inflation, we illustrate that prior knowledge of groups improves density forecasts when the data is not entirely informative. A second application revisits the relationship between a country’s income and its democratic transition; we identify heterogeneous income effects on democracy with five distinct groups over ninety countries.},

  title={Bayesian Estimation of Panel Models under Potentially Sparse Heterogeneity (R&R, Journal of Applied Econometrics)},
  abstract={We incorporate a version of a spike and slab prior, comprising a pointmass at zero ("spike") and a Normal distribution around zero ("slab") into a dynamic panel data framework to model coefficient heterogeneity. In addition to homogeneity and full heterogeneity, our specification can also capture sparse heterogeneity, that is, there is a core group of units that share common parameters and a set of deviators with idiosyncratic parameters. We fit a model with unobserved components to income data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find evidence for sparse heterogeneity for balanced panels composed of individuals with long employment histories.},
